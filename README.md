# Immutable Map

This is a fork of [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.com) that only includes "ImmutableMap" as an ESM package because it's the best immutable Map data structure for JavaScript. Documentation can be found on the [Immutable.js website](https://immutable-js.com).

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @cnakazawa/immutable-map
```

## Usage

```js
import ImmutableMap from '@cnakazawa/immutable-map';
```
